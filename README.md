## A local store used to have sticky notes to order and deliver food items. 

## They want to replace the sticky notes with something more user friendly for the customers and that would expand their business.

## This is the frontend code for the application. Refer the REST API <a href='https://github.com/Madhurya-1997/food-order-notes-api'>here</a>
